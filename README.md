<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is a C++ library to read video data as video and audio frames. If you are looking some library to process video data into numbers for your AI library of video editing software this might be your goto library. You clone the source code and extend this into a new project, currently if supports only video and audio frame extraction for a video file.

Project classes:
* Frame - A base class which all classes inherit. (This opens a video file container and finds the index of stream you need)
* Synchronizer - This keeps and manages all the frame data along with their presentation time stamps. (This is the class whose member functions you will access to extract frames)
* VideoFrame and AudioFrame - As the name suggest the extract respective frames.



### Built With

This is the list of build tools you will need and the frameworks I have used.
